# Modules and Packages

[myProject](./myProject/) is the directory that contains all the files.

 [`adder.py`](./myProject/adder.py) contains the functions `add_3` and `triple`.

[main.py](./myProject/main.py) uses `import` keyword to use the functions defined in the module [`adder.py`](./myProject/adder.py)

In [main_2.py](./myProject/main_2.py) the functions `add_3` and `triple` are duplicated as they are in a different file. By making use of `import` feature [main.py](./myProject/main.py) eliminates the need for duplication.
